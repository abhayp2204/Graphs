# Graphs

## Undirected Graphs
Edge (u, v) is equivalent to (v, u)

## Directed Graphs (Digraphs)
(u, v) is the edge from u to v

## Weighted Graphs
(u, v, w) where w is the cost of edge between u and v

## Tree
An undirected graph with no cycles  
It is a connected graph with N nodes and N-1 edges

### Rooted Tree
There is a designated root where every edge points either away(arborescence) 
from or towards(anti-arborescence) the node

# Graph Algorithms
